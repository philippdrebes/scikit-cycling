    Parameters
    ----------
    max_duration_profile : int or None
        Integer representing the maximum duration in minutes to build the
        record power-profile model. It can be infered if the data are loaded

    cyclist_weight : float, default None
        Float in order to normalise the record power-profile depending
        of its weight. By default this is None in order to avoid
        using the data from normalized rpp without this data.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data_ : array-like, shape (60 * max_duration_rpp, )
        Array in which the record power-profile is stored.
        The units used is the second.

    data_norm_ : array-like, shape (60 * max_duration_rpp, )
        Array in which the weight-normalized record power-profile
        is stored. The units used is the seconds.

    max_duration_data_ : int
        The maximum duration of the record power-profile.

    cyclist_weight_ : float
        Cyclist weight.

    filename_ : str
        The corresponding fit file attached to this power-profile.
