    """Compute the aerobic metabolism model from the record power-profile.

    Parameters
    ----------
    profile : RidePowerProfile or RecordPowerProfile
        The profile that we want to use for computing the different
        statistics.

    ts : ndarray, shape (n_samples, ) or None
        Array containing the sample to take into account.
        If None, the sampling of the method of Pinot is applied, which is
        equivalent to the sampling from WKO+

    normalized : bool, default False
        Return a weight-normalized rpp if True.

    method : string, default 'lsq'
        Which type of tehcnic to use to make the fitting ('lsq', 'lm').

    Returns
    -------
    pma : float
        Maximum Aerobic Power.

    t_pma : int
        Time of the Maximum Aerobic Power in seconds.

    aei : float
        Aerobic Endurance Index.

    fit_info_pma_fitting : dict
        This is a dictionary with the information collected about the fitting
        related to the MAP. The attributes will be the following:

        - `slope`: slope of the linear fitting,
        - `intercept`: intercept of the linear fitting,
        - `std_err`: standard error of the fitting,
        - `coeff_det`: coefficient of determination.

    fit_info_aei_fitting : dict
        This is a dictionary with the information collected about the fitting
        related to the AEI. The attributes will be the following:

        - `slope`: slope of the linear fitting,
        - `intercept`: intercept of the linear fitting,
        - `std_err`: standard error of the fitting,
        - `coeff_det`: coefficient of determination.

    Notes
    -----
    The method implemented here follow the work presented in [1]_.
